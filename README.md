# OTGShopping
Whenever we call go to the shopping in any big mart or shopping malls, billing is sometimes the most tidious work, we need to stand in long 
queues to get our product scanned and bill to be paid. This project is the solution to the problem.
User can log in to the shopping mart's app and scan products by bar code scanner in the app and add items in the list and
after shopping user can click on pay button and a QR Code will be generated and now, user can show QR code to the cashier and
after scanning QR code cashier can see the items in the list, generate slip and all work will be done easily.
